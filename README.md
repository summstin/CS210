* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. <br>
  This program can track the amount of a grocery item that is input, as well as list the stock count of all items and display them in a histogram format.

* What did you do particularly well? <br>
  I feel like I grasped code reusability decently well especially for my last project. I was able to repurpose work from prior assignments which facilitated the process.

* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? <br>
  One place I feel I could enhance my code is in understanding when to utilize pointers ideally. There were probably assignments where it would have made more sense to use them in some cases.
  
* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? <br>
  Utilizing pointers were also the most challenging to figure out when I got to the section until I referred to practical examples.
  
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? <br>
  There are a lot of useful takeaways from the project that I could utilize in other works. Basic class construction, handling input, and processing file input/output will all come in handy.

* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? <br>
  I made the project maintainable by utilizing proper class construction and object instantiation. If I ever wanted to expand the grocery class object, I could simply add new functions or class properties. If I wanted to expand the menu of options, there is a lot of reusable code there too.
